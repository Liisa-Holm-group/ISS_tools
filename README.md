# ISS_tools


**ISS_tools** is a Python package for post-processing and visualization of protein structure alignments generated by DALI. It provides a streamlined workflow for converting, annotating, and analyzing structural similarity results, with a particular focus on integrating Pfam domain information and UniProt metadata. The package is composed of three main components:

1. **DALI Output Conversion** (scripts/dalitool.py)
Converts raw DALI output (from the standalone versions or the DALI web server) into structured TSV format. This standardized output serves as the input for downstream annotation and visualization.
2. **Pfam Assignment** (scripts/pfamtool.py)
Assigns Pfam domains to query proteins or aligned segments using profile HMMs via HMMER. Annotations may reflect the full domain architecture (one-to-many) or a simplified one-to-one mapping restricted to the structurally aligned regions.
3. **Visualization Module** (ISS_tools/visual.py)
Provides functions for static and interactive plots—including scatter plots, heatmaps, and sequence logos—to support interpretation of annotated structural alignment data. Visualizations are designed to highlight relationships between structure, function, and domain composition.
